# Job Skills Extractor Web App

## Features
- Enter a job description or paste a job link (LinkedIn, careers page)
- Extracts and lists the top 10 skills or technologies required for the job

## Tech Stack Proposal
- Frontend: React (with Vite or Create React App)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask) for text extraction and skill analysis
- Skill extraction: Use NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK, or OpenAI API)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
2. Run backend server
3. Run frontend app

This is the initial project scaffold. Next steps: initialize the backend and frontend folders.
